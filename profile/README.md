# Conservation Evidence

**Conservation Evidence** is a free, authoritative resource that helps people make better decisions about conserving biodiversity. We summarise the effects of conservation actions so practitioners, policymakers and researchers can quickly see *what works, what doesn’t, and where evidence is still limited.*

---

## Our mission
- Make conservation decisions **more transparent and effective** by collating and sharing evidence on the outcomes of actions.
- Provide **clear, accessible summaries** that can be used in the field, in policy, and in planning.
- Highlight **evidence gaps** to guide future research and funding.

## What we publish
- **Synopses of evidence**  
  Topic-by-topic summaries reviewing the effectiveness of actions for a species group, habitat or issue.
- **What Works in Conservation**  
  Expert assessments that interpret the summarised evidence to indicate which actions are likely to be effective.
- **Conservation Evidence Journal**  
  A free-to-publish, open-access, peer-reviewed journal reporting tests of conservation actions and their outcomes.

## How we work
1. **Summarise** – We systematically gather and summarise studies that test conservation actions.  
2. **Assess** – Independent experts review the summarised evidence to provide action-level guidance.  
3. **Share** – All outputs are openly available and designed for real-world use.
