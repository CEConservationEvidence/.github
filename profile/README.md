# Conservation Evidence

**Helping conservation practitioners make better-informed decisions by summarising and sharing what works.**

---

## Who we are

Conservation Evidence (CE) is an independent, non-profit initiative that gathers and summarises global research on the effectiveness of conservation actions. Our aim is simple: **make reliable evidence easy to find and use** by people making day-to-day decisions for nature.

We work with researchers, practitioners, policy-makers and funders to improve the link between science and practice, and to encourage learning from both success and failure.

## Our mission

- **Collate** research on the effects of conservation actions across species, habitats and threats.  
- **Summarise** that research in accessible, concise formats for busy practitioners.  
- **Synthesis & guidance:** bring evidence together into practical, action-focused messages that support real-world decisions.  
- **Open access:** keep resources free to read and reuse wherever possible.  
- **Improve practice:** encourage transparent reporting, adaptive management and learning across the conservation community.

## What we do

- **Evidence summaries & synopses**  
  Topic-focused collections that capture the state of knowledge on conservation actions for a taxonomic group or habitat. Each synopsis includes study summaries, background context and key messages.

- **Living evidence**  
  We update our resources over time as new studies are published, so practitioners can rely on current knowledge when planning and evaluating interventions.

- **Independent journal**  
  We support the publication of practical conservation research and case studies, helping lessons from the field to be shared widely.

- **Partnerships & training**  
  We collaborate with organisations worldwide and provide guidance on finding and using evidence in practice.
